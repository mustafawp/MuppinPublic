## This Repository Info

### This project was started to be developed in August 2023 to be an early access version of Muppin, but the development of the project was cancelled because the file structures and database codes were very bad. Some of the code in the project has been shared publicly as it may be useful.

### The source codes of this project and the "Muppin Early Access | Version #2" project are completely different.
